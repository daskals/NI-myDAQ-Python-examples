# NI-myDAQ-Python-examples

In this repository we try to attach some python examples for controlling the National Instruments (NI) myDAQ.

every script uses the <<import nidaqmx.system>> at the begging 

The nidaqmx package contains an API (Application Programming Interface) for interacting with the NI-DAQmx driver. 
The package is implemented in Python and it was created and is supported by NI. 
The package is implemented as a complex, highly object-oriented wrapper around the NI-DAQmx C API using the ctypes Python library.

The repository also include a folder with MATLAB examples as references
