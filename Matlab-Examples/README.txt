MATLAB supports NI myDAQ hardware through the Data Acquisition Toolbox. This simple example shows how to setup a DAQ session with myDAQ hardware.
Specifically, the example illustrates how to discover the device, establish a connection with the device, change the sampling rate, change the voltage range and acquire and plot data.
